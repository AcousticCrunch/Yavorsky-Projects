# Stack Project

Welcome to my stack-based data structure project!

I utilized an underlying vector to create an in-depth stack data structure.

I use my stack to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression, given by the user.

Features:

* Template-based stack

* Comprehensive member functions (push and move push)

* Boolean comparison operator overloads
